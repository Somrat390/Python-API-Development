Pydantic for making schema 
Now why we need schema??

==> In backend we expect data in title and content not any extra data from fortnend
user data can be unvalid they can send blank title but we accept data in a structure
so to force user to send the data in structre way we have to make a schema

And this schema is made by Pydantic.

Work principle:
from pydantic import BaseModel

then have to make a schema throug a cls
