Real-Life Scenario: Online Banking

You open your banking app and fill out the “Transfer Money” form:

From: Your account

To: Friend’s account

Amount: $100

When you click Submit, the app sends a POST request to the bank’s server with your data:

{
  "from_account": "12345",
  "to_account": "67890",
  "amount": 100
}


The server processes it:

Deducts $100 from your account

Adds $100 to your friend’s account

Returns a response: "Transfer successful!"

📌 Here, the POST request creates a new transaction in the system.
