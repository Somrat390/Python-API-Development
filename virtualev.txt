Good question 👍 Let’s break it down step by step:

---

### 1. `py` vs `py -3`

* On **Windows**, `py` is the **Python launcher**.
* Writing `py -3` tells the launcher:
  👉 “Run Python 3 (the default installed Python 3 version on this system).”
* If you also have **Python 2** installed (less common nowadays), `py` (without `-3`) might pick the wrong version, depending on configuration.

---

### 2. `-m venv venv1`

* `-m venv` means: “Run the `venv` module to create a virtual environment.”
* `venv1` is just the name of the folder where the virtual environment will be created.

---

### 3. So what’s the difference?

* ✅ `py -3 -m venv venv1` → Forces Python 3 to be used to create the venv. Safe if you have multiple versions.
* ✅ `py -m venv venv1` → Uses whichever Python version is the **default** (configured in `py` launcher). If Python 3 is the only one installed, it’ll usually work fine.

---

### 4. Example Scenarios

* If you have **only Python 3.12** installed:
  `py -m venv venv1` = `py -3 -m venv venv1` → Both same.
* If you have **Python 2.7 and Python 3.12** installed:

  * `py -m venv venv1` → Could run Python 2 (error, since `venv` doesn’t exist in Python 2).
  * `py -3 -m venv venv1` → Always runs with Python 3, works fine.

---

✅ **Rule of thumb:**

* Use `py -3 -m venv venv1` if you aren’t sure which version `py` will pick.
* Use `py -m venv venv1` if you know Python 3 is your default (simpler).

Do you want me to also show you how to check which Python version `py` (without `-3`) will run on your system?




We are using Global interpreturn python to use specific enterpeter we have to write

.\venv1\Scripts\python.exe 

Now for activate virtual environment we have to write

venv1\Scripts\activate.bat

Now open server 
uvicorn main:app  // main is file name and app is instance name of fastapi
